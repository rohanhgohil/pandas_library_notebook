# Pandas Series and DataFrame

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to work with the Pandas library to manipulate and analyze data using Series and DataFrame data structures. The code covers various operations and data selection techniques for both 1D Series and 2D DataFrame.

### Requirements
- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- Pandas library (install using pip install pandas)

### 1. Series Data Structure (1D)
This section demonstrates the creation and manipulation of 1D Series using the Pandas library. It includes operations like creating Series with default and custom indexes, accessing index and data types, and selecting data using slicing and conditional filtering.

### 2. DataFrame Data Structure (2D)
In this section, you will learn how to create and work with 2D DataFrames using Pandas. It covers creating DataFrames from dictionaries, accessing index, columns, and values attributes, and changing row index labels.

### 3. Data Selection in a DataFrame
Here, we explore different ways to select data in a DataFrame, including selecting columns using dot notation and square brackets, accessing rows using index locations and label-based selection with the loc and iloc methods.
